# Master PRD: ChatSpend

## Vision
ChatSpend is a chat-based expense tracker that lets users log spending and query insights in natural language or SMS/Telegram. It automates categorisation with OpenAI functions, stores data in Supabase, and provides friendly summaries via Next.js UI. Hosting via Vercel ensures fast deployment. We target rapid prototype toward $10k MRR with enterprise-grade quality.

## Goals
- Frictionless conversational interface for recording expenses
- AI-generated analytics such as monthly totals or category spend
- Multichannel input: web chat and SMS/Telegram
- Secure auth with Supabase
- CI/CD to Vercel with automated tests

## Success Metrics
- Time to log first expense < 60s
- Query accuracy > 90% vs manual tracking
- Daily active users > 100 within 3 months

## Out of Scope
- Complex budgeting features
- Multi-currency support
